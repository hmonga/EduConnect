# PocketLab - Science Lab in Your Pocket

Transform your smartphone into a portable science laboratory with real-time sensors and interactive chemistry experiments.

## üåü About the Project

PocketLab addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by making hands-on science education accessible to underprivileged communities with limited resources. Using built-in smartphone sensors and offline-first technology, students can conduct physics experiments and chemistry reactions without expensive lab equipment or reliable internet access.

### Inspiration
Traditional science education requires expensive equipment, dedicated lab spaces, and reliable internet - resources many students lack. With over 6 billion smartphones worldwide, we saw an opportunity to democratize science education by leveraging devices students already have.

### What it does
- **Real-time Physics Experiments**: Uses accelerometer, gyroscope, and sound sensors for hands-on learning
- **Interactive Chemistry Lab**: 180+ chemical reactions with drag-and-drop elements and realistic visuals
- **Offline-First Design**: Works without internet after initial visit
- **Educational Content**: Built-in learning objectives, sample activities, and real-time tips
- **Data Export**: CSV export for analysis and scientific method practice

### How we built it
Built as a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and Web APIs. Uses DeviceMotion, DeviceOrientation, and MediaDevices APIs for sensor access. Chemistry engine simulates realistic reactions with temperature effects and visual feedback. Progressive Web App features enable offline functionality and home screen installation.

### Challenges we ran into
- iOS sensor permission handling required DeviceMotionEvent.requestPermission()
- Chemistry reaction system needed complex state management to prevent repeats
- Offline functionality required Service Worker implementation
- Visual effects needed careful optimization for mobile performance

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Created a fully functional science lab accessible on any smartphone
- Implemented 180+ unique chemical reactions with educational content
- Built offline-first design for communities with limited internet
- Made complex physics concepts accessible through interactive visualizations
- Achieved open-source, reproducible codebase for continued development

### What we learned
- Web Sensor APIs have different implementations across platforms
- Progressive Web Apps can provide native-like experiences
- Chemistry education can be gamified while maintaining scientific accuracy
- Offline-first design is crucial for accessibility in underprivileged communities

### What's next for PocketLab
- Expand chemistry reactions and add more elements
- Implement collaborative features for classroom use
- Add AR features for enhanced visual learning
- Create teacher dashboard for lesson planning
- Develop curriculum integration guides
